I am currently a second-year PhD student in Machine Learning and Optimization at Sorbonne Université. I work within the Department of Statistics (LPSM) under the supervision of [Antoine Godichon-Baggioni](https://godichon.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) (Sorbonne Université), [Sylvain Le Corff](https://sylvainlc.github.io/) (Sorbonne Université), and [Adeline Fermanian](https://afermanian.github.io/) (Califrais). My research focuses on the theoretical aspects of Stochastic Optimization and Generative Models. Additionally, I am particularly interested in applying Deep Learning to solve Vehicle Routing Problems.
